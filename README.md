# docket
Easy way to generate some documents by versioning them into the ckeditor environment. Make documents in a second and toggle them into your `Document` indexes.

# Structure
You can generate lots of documents for your project. docket uses Bootstrap 4 which is so flexible for API generations. Write your scripts, headers, paragraphs, and quotas in the ckeditor and let Bootstrap style them.

# Preview
Here is the list that you would create on the Django Admin Panel(DAP). DAP is available on `localhost:8000/admin` by default. You might have chosen a different port address or already changed the DAP path.

Now, here we have our document viewer which has been designed by Bootstrap. Modify classes, make some CSS codes, and create your own favorite scheme. Here is the default scheme of the Docket.

# Setup your Scheme
You may not prefer the default scheme of docket. Don't concern about it. Make it feels better. You have to be familiar with CSS and design your tags properly. The changes you make, will be overwrititten on the default styles of Bootstrap.

Also use `pygmentify` to beautify your JSON, Script, and Code blocks and make them look better. If you want to set it up, make sure you have already read the [pygmentify document](https://django-pygmentify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

# docket
Easy way to generate some documents by versioning them into the ckeditor environment. Make documents in a second and toggle them into your `Document` indexes.

# Structure
You can generate lots of documents for your project. docket uses Bootstrap 4 which is so flexible for API generations. Write your scripts, headers, paragraphs, and quotas in the ckeditor and let Bootstrap style them.
